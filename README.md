# Cracking the Coding Interview with Python
Solutions for [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com "Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition") by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com "Gayle Laakmann").

I wanted to document my own solutions and crowdsource additional solutions to see different approaches for the same problems. Contributions welcomed and encouraged!

#### Pro Tip
Cracking the Coding Interview is a great resource to learn many valuable software engineering skills.  It is also fantastic for getting practice with technical interviewing type questions!  However, you only get the most value if you practice writing them out by hand. It is *highly* recommended that you only type up your solutions to test them more throughly, catch syntax errors, and fix newly found bugs. 

#### Who This is For
Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute! We encourage solutions in python, but it is not required :)

#### How to Contribute
It is as simple as just pushing your own solution for an already provided problem or adding your own from the book!  However, we do like to follow some rules and guidelines to keep everything clean and uniform!

1. Write quality code and follow guidelines.
2. Check your code against the test file --> if no test file exists create one!
3. Add tests to the test files if applicable.
4. Open a pull request and provide a descriptive comment for what you did and we will merge it into the master if it meets guidelines

~~~~
# Guidelines
''' Doc Strings at the top of files to describe the problem.
Problem section: (problem number) x.y - Problem Name.  Full Description
'''
-Tests: What test cases are you going to run your code against.  
Did you catch all edge cases?

-Out loud Thoughts: Explain what you are thinking,
any assumptions, questions you might ask.

-Code
use descriptive naming, modular code, and keep it simple stupid!

Please add time complexity comments throughout the code.
At the end add a summary statement for the overall
bigO and space complexity.
